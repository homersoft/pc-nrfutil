// This is a Jenkins pipeline file used to perform a static code analysis and automatic tagging with a new version
// number ( in x.y.z notation) when a merge to a certain branch is made. Automatic tagging increase only last digit (z)
// in the new version number. When you want to change first (x) or second (y) digit in the new version number you have
// to use ALTERNATIVE_VERSION parameter in Jenkins job.
// For the status to be visible on GitHub, you have to add "seedlabs-ateam" collaborator & add "Jenkins (Git plugin)"
// service to your git repository.
// During the first launch, you have to enter ALTERNATIVE_VERSION parameter.
